# SSH Keys management
Ledger Nano devices (Nano S and Nano X) are open platforms leveraging the security of Secure Elements. Ledger Operating System allows to load applications which use the cryptographic APIs. The OS also offers isolation and can leverage key derivations mechanisms offered by the OS.

This technology offers a high level of security even against an attacker with a physical access to your devices.

Thus Nano devices are the perfect tools to manage securely your crypto-assets. But they are also very well suited to manage your SSH keys.


# SSH App

The SSH tool is very simple and is composed of 2 different tools:
* An App running on your Nano (S/X) - [source code](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-ssh-agent/)
* An Agent running on your Linux machine - [pip package](https://pypi.org/project/ledger_agent)


The app runing on your device is in charge of the key management and of the digital signatures computation for authentication. 

SSH, or Secure Shell is a remote administration protocol. It allows to mount secure channel from your computer to the remote server. Mounting a secure channel allows 2 security properties:
* Authentication
* Confidentiality

Authentication consists in proving the identity of a computer. In the case of SSH, it's ensured using digital signatures. Using the SSH app, these signatures are performed within the device. In this framework, the private key never leaves the secure element inside. 
The confidentiality is ensured sharing an ephemeral key between both parts. This key sharing is performed using an (EC)DH.

# Step-by-step setup

## Installation
Get you Nano S or your Nano X, make sure you have enough space to install the app.

<br/>

Launch [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/) on your desktop. In Ledger Live,
* Go to Settings > Experimental Features, and activate **Developer Mode**

<center>

</center>
<br/>

* Install the app on your Nano. In the **Manager**, search for SSH app and install it.

</center>
<br/>

<center>
<img src="/assets/ssh/live-manager-install.png" >
</center>
<br/>

You should now have the **SSH/PGP Agent** installed on your Nano device. You won't need Ledger Live after that (except for managing your coins of course :) ).


* Make sure you have python3 and libusb:

```bash
$ sudo apt install python3 libusb
```

* Install ledger_agent.


```bash
$ pip3 install ledger_agent
```

## Generate your SSH key on the device
Unlock your Nano and launch the **SSH/PGP Agent** app.

<center>
<img src="/assets/ssh/ssh-home.jpg" >
</center>
<br/>

On your terminal, run **ledger-agent**:

```bash
$ ledger-agent username@hostname
```

You will be requested to confirm the operation on the device.

</center>
<br/>

You now have public key.
```bash
ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBCSu3oGKedvLzJpzQr0kGCr7eIyXy67zszMcQCnDUmeAzqlZt9skK0vM/HDquta8vNH77Y9gfjaEWozzfpYCSe0= <ssh://username@hostname|nist256p1>
```
You can copy it in the *~/.ssh/authorized_keys* file of your remote server.


## Use this key with your usual SSH Agent and Git...
Add your SSH Public key Identifier into a file.
```bash
$ echo "<ssh://username@hostname|nist256p1>" > ~/.ssh/nanox-keys.conf
```
And run the ledger-agent to link it with your shell.

```bash
$ ledger-agent ~/.ssh/nanox.conf -s -v
```

You can now connect your remote server using ssh from your device.
```bash
$ ssh username@hostname
```

</center>
<br/>

You can also use Git the same way.
For instance, with Github:
* In your Github Settings > SSH and GPG keys, add a new SSH key

<center>
<img src="/assets/ssh/ssh-github.png" >
</center>
<br/>

Then you can use Github with SSH, and the SSH keys are secure in your device.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc.git
```
<center>
<img src="/assets/ssh/ssh-github-device.png" >
</center>
<br/>

Et voil√†. Your ssh keys are secure :)

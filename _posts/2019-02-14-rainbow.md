[Rainbow](https://github.com/Ledger-Donjon/rainbow) is a Python module designed for two purposes. 
First one is to help embedded developers test their implementations against basic side-channel attacks (together with our side-channel analysis tool Lascar) and later, against fault injection.

The second one is to give some tools to trace whiteboxed binaries in order to break them, much like Side-Channel Marvels except with a different usage.

## State of embedded affairs

Embedded devices are flourishing with vulnerabilities everywhere and things will only get worse as the number of uses for those grow.  
Besides the now usual software vulnerabilities one should take care of when developing for such devices, there are also physical attacks which come into play.
Side-channel attacks attempts to retrieve secret keys using power or electromagnetic emanations. 
Fault injections use laser or electromagnetic pulses, clock and voltage glitching to change the behaviour of the code running on the device at specific points. A PIN code comparison is blocking an attacker from accessing your data ? No problem, he can submit a random PIN code and skip the comparison entirely.

The state of affairs of embedded development is this : there are no tools widely available to test against those attacks at the development stage (rather than when the product is finished) and that do not involve buying possibly expensive equipment and expertise (oscilloscopes, probes, laser, ...).

The [REASSURE](https://reassure.eu) project did provide an emulator for Cortex-M0 specifically (https://github.com/bristol-sca/ELMO/), but we would like to take things a bit further in terms of tooling and provide something more generic.

There was also a suggestion and some draft scripts to achieve side-channel tracing and fault injection with the Unicorn engine, the same tool we will be using, back in [2015](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-15/materials/eu-15-Sanfelix-Unboxing-The-White-Box-Practical-Attacks-Against-Obfuscated-Ciphers-wp.pdf) but this was left as a draft piece of code in an appendix.

## How this tool works

This tool is built on the [Unicorn Engine](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn) which allows emulating code snippets for several CPU targets : x86, x86_64, ARM, M68k, ...
Using the right set of code instrumentation primitives or 'hooks', we can extract intermediate data from registers or memory accesses dynamically during execution.

This enables simulating a side-channel leakage : the user provides some input to the emulated function, and the tool leaks the intermediate values during the execution.

There are other solutions to trace the execution of a program, but in the case of embedded or firmware code, there are difficulties to use those tools.
Using Unicorn allows to rip specific parts of the code out of the firmware to test them. Another option could be to simply recompile the code to be tested as a program by itself and use those other tools available (Intel Pin, Valgrind) to trace them, but this has drawbacks :

- The produced binary may end up different from what is in the firmware, and may not contain the same flaws
- For each platform you need to test on, there needs to be one version of the aforementioned tools, and possibly different scripts
- You simply might not have access to the source code !

As for fault injection, one can force the execution to skip an instruction in many ways, or use Unicorn's hooks to execute a very specific value into a register, and check how the code behaves.

## Make it easy to use

The tool was made as architecture-agnostic as possible, meaning the tracing behaves the same whether it emulates an x86 CPU or an ARM Cortex one.
Capstone is used to detect what registers are affected by an instruction, so that we can precisely select what to leak for each instruction, independently of the CPU.
 
Another important step was to provide basic functions to load common binaries encountered in embedded development : raw binary files, ELF and Intel Hex formats are all easily loaded into the emulator in a single command.

## Implementation

### Hooking memory accesses

Unicorn already provides this kind of hook :

```python
import unicorn as uc

TRACE = []

def mem_hook(uci, access, address, size, value, user_data):
    if access == uc.UC_MEM_WRITE:
        TRACE.append(value)
    else:
        TRACE.append(int.from_bytes(uci.mem_read(address, size), 'little'))

emu = uc.Uc(uc.UC_ARCH_ARM, uc.UC_MODE_THUMB)
emu.hook_add(uc.UC_HOOK_MEM_READ | uc.UC_HOOK_MEM_WRITE, mem_hook)
```

The function `mem_hook` will be called on every instruction that performs a memory read or write.
Inside this function, we append either the value that is going to be written, or the value that is read (which we have to read manually from the address provided by Unicorn).

### Hooking register values

We chose to implement something that traces any register move. This time we need a `CODE` hook which will be called on every instruction just before executing.
To determine which registers will be affected, we use Capstone 4's `regs_access()` API. We disassemble the current instruction and retrieve the registers that it implicitly and explicitly writes to.
For example, `ldr r0, [sp, #8]` will modify `r0` only.

```python
import unicorn as uc
import capstone as cs

TRACE = []

def code_hook(uci, address, size, user_data):
    # ...
    # Handle previous 'next_leak' value
    # ...
    current_ins = bytes(uci.mem_read(address, size))
    disas_ins = cs.disasm(current_ins, address, 1)[0]
    regs_read, regs_written = disas_ins.regs_access()

    if len(regs_written) > 0:
        reg_leak = disas_ins.reg_name(regs_written[0])


emu = uc.Uc(uc.UC_ARCH_ARM, uc.UC_MODE_THUMB)
dis = cs.Cs(cs.CS_ARCH_ARM, cs.CS_MODE_THUMB)
dis.detail = True

emu.hook_add(uc.UC_HOOK_CODE, code_hook)
```

As this hook is called before executing, we defer the reading of the leaked register to the next time the hook is called (which is the following instruction).

## Make it extensible

The tool was designed originally for our own use, which includes testing on Secure Elements. That means we need to develop a tracer based on a generic ARM tracer for example, and add in peripheral simulation easily and also special register naming in the case of debug traces. 

Again, Unicorn's hooks allow this rather seamlessly. Our tool was built with this in mind, so that there is very little work to do to produce a tracer for a whole new device with its own memory mapping, peripherals, and so on.

A simple example is adding a hook on a True Random Number Generator. 

### Example : Simulating a TRNG

We can do this one of two ways. Either we know that the code will get its random values from some self-contained function and we can hook this, or we know the TRNG register's address and can write to it just before it is read. 

Hooking or redefining a function is directly handled in rainbow. Function names and addresses are loaded together with the binary in the case of ELF files and there is some internal dictionary mapping function names to python functions that can be passed to the rainbow instance. Some code block hook (called everytime the code jumps)  will check when entering a function whether its name also points to a user function.  

If it does, the execution is redirected to the user function and can return to the original function - acting as a prolog - or return to the caller.

```python
# rainbow passes the whole instance as a parameter
# for function redefinition
def new_genrandom(e):
    e['r0'] = 0x12345678
    return True  # Tell rainbow to return to the caller

# We pass in the whole script's globals
emu = rainbow_stm32f215(local_vars={'generate_random': new_genrandom})

# Some binary that contains a 'generate_random' function
emu.load('example.elf')
```

In case the binary file does not have any symbol information, we can do this manually if we know its address : 

```python
emu = rainbow_stm32f215(local_vars={'generate_random': new_genrandom})
emu.load('example.bin')
emu.stubbed_functions = {'generate_random': 0x40808004}
```

Now the second way to do this, hooking register reads to the TRNG's address :

```python
from random import getrandbits

emu = rainbow_stm32f215()

TRNG_address = 0x50060800

def new_genrandom(uci, access, address, size, value, user_data):
    emu[TRNG_address] = getrandbits(32) 

emu.emu.hook_add(uc.UC_HOOK_MEM_READ, new_genrandom, begin=TRNG_address, end=TRNG_address)
```

It is simply a memory read hook that is active only on this particular address. It is called just before Unicorn actually executes the instruction, so the hook function writes directly in the register and it will be read by the emulated code when the hook is exited.

## What does it look like ?

First, we need to grab a trace after the code was executed :

```python
emu = rainbow_cortexm(sca_mode=True)
emu.trace_regs = True
emu.mem_trace = True

emu.start(0x408080, 0, count=1000)

disassembly = emu.sca_address_trace
trace = emu.sca_values_trace
```

There is a viewer based on [VisPy](https://github.com/vispy/vispy) embedded with our code, accessible under `rainbow.utils.plot`.

The first one takes several traces and simply displays them with a different color, much like matplotlib would do except VisPy makes things a lot quicker :

```python
from rainbow.utils.plot import plot, viewer

plot(trace)
```

![show something]()

The other viewer synchronizes a view between the instruction trace and the values :

```python
viewer(disassembly, trace)
```

Using this we can pinpoint exactly what instruction leaks nad how much. Once we gather several traces of the same function with different inputs, we can use [Lascar](https://github.com/Ledger-Donjon/lascar) to attack it and try to retrieve the key. 

### Example : An AES optimized for Cortex-M

Let's attack the AES's sbox output in the first round on [this implementation](https://github.com/Ko-/aes-armcortexm/tree/public/aes128).

Using the example available on our github repo, we get these execution traces after adding some noise to make it look real :

![cortexm_traces](/assets/cortexm_traces.jpg)

And now the results of a CPA on the first sbox yields :

```python
plot(results, highlight=0x00)  # highlights one specific curve among others
```

![cortexm_cpa](/assets/cortexm_cpa.jpg)

It's broken !

## Next steps

We provided several examples on our GitHub to showcase what our tool can do in various situations.
You will find :
- A simple debug trace example, which showcases some of the added information in a rainbow trace
- An embedded example : how to trace an AES specially optimized for Cortex M platforms and break it using Lascar
- A whitebox example : a script that breaks our own Ledger CTF2 Challenge from last year

But there is no fault injection example available yet, although we have some of those ready. Making a nice interface for fault injection is one of the next tasks before publishing them.

There are also more convincing examples of embedded side-channel tests that we will publish as soon as we're allowed to !
